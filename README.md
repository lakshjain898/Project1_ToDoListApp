# To-Do List Application

This is a **To-Do List Application** built using Python and Tkinter. The app provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to manage daily tasks efficiently. It uses **file handling** for data persistence, ensuring tasks are saved even after the application is closed.

---

## Features

### 1. **Add Tasks**
- Input new tasks through an entry field and add them to the list with a single click.

### 2. **Delete Tasks**
- Select a task from the list and delete it using the `Delete Task` button.

### 3. **Clear All Tasks**
- Quickly clear the entire task list with the `Clear All` button. A confirmation prompt ensures accidental deletions are avoided.

### 4. **Persistent Storage**
- Tasks are saved in a file (`tasks.txt`) so that they persist across sessions.

### 5. **Scrollable List**
- Integrated scrollbar allows for easy navigation of long task lists.

### 6. **Modern and Clean Design**
- Styled with a minimalistic and user-friendly interface.
